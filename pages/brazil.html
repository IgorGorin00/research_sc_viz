    The selection of Export Processing Zones (EPZs) in Brazil, which are
    equivalent to Special Economic Zones (SEZs), is primarily driven by data
    availability. Despite the absence of a comprehensive website for all EPZs,
    the Ministry of Economy's website provides a list of EPZs and their
    respective regions, albeit with limited information. To conduct a Synthetic
    Control analysis, the year of EPZ creation is necessary, but obtaining this
    information for most EPZs is challenging due to the lack of dedicated
    websites. Therefore, the selection of EPZs for analysis was based on the
    availability of necessary information. Additionally, the argument that a
    substantial amount of pre-intervention data is essential for modeling
    supports this approach. However, data collection for EPZs in Brazil was less
    favorable than that for Russia and India. Data was collected from two
    primary sources: the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE),
    which provided data on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Brazilian states
    through its "Regional Accounts of Brazil" and "Annual Survey of Industry,"
    and the Central Bank of Brazil, which offered information on exports via its
    "Time Series Management System." While data on foreign direct investments
    was available, including the country and industry of investments, regional
    investment amounts were not obtainable.
