  <h1>Welcome to my Master's Thesis Presentation</h1>
  <p>
    This project is a digital, interactive exploration of my master's thesis in
    which I've conducted an analysis of the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in
    India, Russia, and Brazil. Instead of a traditional static presentation,
    I've decided to present my research findings through this web-based
    application, offering an interactive and engaging experience for the viewer.
  </p>
  <h2>About the Research</h2>
  <p>
    My research utilizes the synthetic control methodology to evaluate and
    compare the impact of Special Economic Zones in India, Russia, and Brazil.
    SEZs are areas within countries that have unique economic regulations
    separate from the rest of the country. Their impacts on economic
    development, foreign direct investment, and the regional economy can be
    significant and thus, it's crucial to understand their effects.
  </p>
  <h2>About This Application</h2>
  <p>
    To make this research more accessible and engaging, I have incorporated a
    variety of visualizations that are interactive and animated. You can
    navigate through the research findings for each country, understand the
    methodologies used, and dive deeper into the datasets employed in my
    analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may navigate to the pages dedicated to each country using the links
    below:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a class="data-source-link" href="/india">India</a></li>
    <li><a class="data-source-link" href="/russia">Russia</a></li>
    <li><a class="data-source-link" href="/brazil">Brazil</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Navigate</h2>
  <p>
    The navigation bar at the top of the page allows you to select the country
    of interest. Upon selecting a country, you'll be presented with a detailed
    analysis of the impacts of SEZs in that country, complete with interactive
    graphs and charts.
  </p>
  <h2>Further Work</h2>
  <p>
    While my master's thesis provides an in-depth analysis of the Special
    Economic Zones in India, Russia, and Brazil, I am looking forward to
    extending this research to include more countries and economic factors.
