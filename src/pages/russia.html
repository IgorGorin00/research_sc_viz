    The logic behind this choice lies primarily in data availability and the
    restrictions of the Synthetic control methodology. The statistics from the
    regional level in Russia are available starting from the year 2000, till the
    year 2021. The primary resource of statistical data is the regional
    compendium

      >“Rosstat. Regions” published annually by the Russian statistical
      agency</a
    >, last release took place on December 31, 2022. Synthetic controls require
    a considerable amount of data before the intervention took place - in my
    case, there must be a considerable amount of data before the SEZ was
    created.
